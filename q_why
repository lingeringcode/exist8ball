Dude.|That?s dangerous business!|If it works, it?s obsolete.|I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.|The missing link created far more interest than all the chains and explanations of being.|I am the walrus.|The answers are always inside the problem, not outside.|Why is it so easy to acquire the solutions of past problems and so difficult to solve current ones?|Mud sometimes gives the illusion of depth.|Life begins on the other side of despair.
